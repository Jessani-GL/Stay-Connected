# Stay-Connected

This project was made in 2020 during my first year and second semester of univeristy. The project was produced a group of five other people including myself. The original Github repository is here: https://github.com/s3728629/Saucy-Onigiri-Assignment-2.

Our task was to create a project that would be useful towards society. The project called, 'Stay Connected,' aims to assist the elderly in educating them on how to communicate with others online. This was a relevant at the time due to quarantine.
